As a java developer I need a readme.md file to add to my new created project named "Generative AI - Use Case #7". 
Please provide this readme.me in a way that I can copy and past with the format.

The file should contain an introduction that will be a test description of 2 paragraphs, 4-10 Sentences. This part should be created based on the testing code that I will provide and the description of the project goal.

Description of the project goal:

Validation Project execution
Use Case #7
Use Case Title
Create unit tests that cover functionality to improve the quality and safety of the application.

Use Case Description
Create unit tests that cover individual functions or methods by using testing libraries. Additionally, group related tests by the respective suite and write common configurations for the tests that should be executed before and after each test in the suite. Further, use the solution to optimize element selections and matching when necessary.

Now the testing code is

Also this readme.md  will be for a java project. I would like that anyone using my project would be able to download it from github and run it locally on their machine. It should then contain the basic instructions to make it work. Remember to not forget to include differences between operational systems, if possible a java installation for java jdk 17 corrretto. Include the commands to run the application through the maven wrapper in the project. Provide also the commands to run clean verify and clean install and checking the code coverage results with jacoco

ChatGPT
Certainly! Below is a README.md file tailored to your Java project, "Generative AI - Use Case #7."

Generative AI - Use Case #7
Introduction
The "Generative AI - Use Case #7" project aims to improve the safety and quality of applications by providing an extensive unit testing suite. These tests cover individual functions and methods of various entities like Student and Player, simulating multiple real-world scenarios to ensure code robustness.

To elaborate, the project uses the JUnit 5 library to perform a comprehensive set of tests. It goes beyond mere function testing to include "Positive Tests", "Negative Tests", and additional "Corner Cases". The test suites contain common configurations that are executed before and after each test, thus providing a clean, isolated environment for each test case. The code even optimizes element selections and matching to ensure the most efficient testing process.

this application it is a pure java application only with junit5 module included in pom.xml. Please remove the part with spring boot information. Just put the instructions to build the project and run tests using the maven wrapper.
ChatGPT
Certainly! Below is the revised README.md for your project "Generative AI - Use Case #7," which focuses on a pure Java application using JUnit 5 for testing.

Generative AI - Use Case #7
Introduction
The "Generative AI - Use Case #7" project focuses on enhancing the quality and safety of Java applications by establishing a robust unit testing framework. Our comprehensive suite of unit tests are built on JUnit 5 and cover individual functions and methods for the Student and Player entities, ensuring that the code is reliable and robust.

Each test suite is broken down into "Positive Tests", "Negative Tests", and special "Corner Cases" to fully explore the code's behavior under different conditions. Before and after each test within a suite, common configurations are executed to ensure a clean, isolated environment. This ensures that our tests are both effective and efficient.

When using prompt commands can you use the way with $ like it was done for the first time? Just use the first readme.md example but maintain the shell standard for all prompts instead of having shell, bash and ruby all mixed. It should be only shell, should contain the prompt format with $ and color lint. Please use the first readme.md as reference

$ ./mvnw clean install
Run Tests
For all operating systems, you can run the unit tests using the Maven Wrapper like so:

shell
Copy code
$ ./mvnw clean test
This change reflects the use of the Maven Wrapper just for running the tests, without installing the project artifacts.




User
Can you add a section explaining how to generate and check jacoco reports on browser?
ChatGPT
Certainly, adding information about generating code coverage reports with JaCoCo and how to view them in a browser can be useful for anyone looking to evaluate the test coverage of the project. Here's how you can include that section in your README.md:

Generate and View JaCoCo Reports
JaCoCo is used for checking code coverage of the project's tests. To generate a JaCoCo report, navigate to the project directory:

shell
Copy code
$ cd generative-ai-case-07
Run the following command to generate the JaCoCo code coverage report:

shell
Copy code
$ ./mvnw clean verify
This will create a report in target/site/jacoco/index.html. To view the report, open the index.html file with a web browser:

shell
Copy code
$ open target/site/jacoco/index.html
Note: The open command works on macOS and some Linux distributions. On Windows, you can navigate to the directory and double-click index.html to open it, or use your preferred command to open files.

This report will give you detailed information about code coverage, which can help you identify areas of the code that may not be adequately tested.

Feel free to include this section in your README.md to provide comprehensive guidance on code coverage reports with JaCoCo.
